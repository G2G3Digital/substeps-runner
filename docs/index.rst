Welcome to Substeps Runner!
===========================

- `Substeps <http://technophobia.github.com/substeps/>`_ is an open-source Behaviour Driven Development (`BDD <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development>`_) test framework created by `Technophobia <http://www.technophobia.com/>`_.
- These pages describe the maven plugin that can be used to execute suites of Substeps tests.
- For full instructions as to how to setup a substeps project, please refer to the main susbteps pages for more details.

Overview
--------
- The substeps maven plugin can execute a number of configurations as part of an integration test.
  Each configuration can be tailored to use specific properties, sets of tests or alternate 
  initialisation classes and or step implementations.  

- On completion of the maven plugin execution, a report is generated with details of the tests executed,
  passed and failed, along with any details of the failure.
